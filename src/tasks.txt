/ wip status:
// - trips will be created only if route is plan/create
// - change it to /create ^
// - now we can't create trips if not logged in - need to fix. (if not logged in create only on local storage)
// - need to have a way to know if trip is db or local storage.
// - need to sync only if clicked on sync button. if synced - it need to be removed from local storage and be stored **only** on db.
// - verify it good before doing that, and backup dubai and viena first ^^

// - make events with timing problems more noticeable (currently red-border)
// - add filter of show only events with problematic hours (and make sure it'll show them even though we're on filter mode)
// - add price (!) and total price (!)
// - add "leave at X to arrive on time" to list view (!!)

// DBService vs LocalStorageService, both implements the same base class/interface - wip - todo complete
// started implementing functions on DBService, need to continue, and
// ... on every place we used to call local storage service - call db service instead if it's a db trip
// ... whenevery tripName is set, set also dbSource in event-store.
// ... make sure to update it whenever trip changes, carefully to avoid mix-match
// .. add sync button to each trip in the local trips
// .. add sync all option.
// if the user does not have local trips and connected, do not show this tab anymore.
// find a different design to distinguish local and db trips. (not white and gray backgrounds)
// V Tab view between local trips and account trips

// V move success, error modals to the regular modals service and use it. use the same function so we can maybe move it too easily.

// 2. allow local trips if user is not logged in at the moment. todo complete
